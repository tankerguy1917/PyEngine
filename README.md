# PyEngine

# About
PyEngine is my attempt at making a game engine using python.
Most of what is in it you can probably just do with pygame, but I'm doing it anyway
Initially, this was just for me to test out using classes and class methods, but then I decided to make a game engin out of it.
I might not finish this, and I dont really think that will be to big of a deal, I mean, the whole purpose of this originally was to get better at using classes, and it fufulled its purpose
